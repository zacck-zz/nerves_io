## Simplistic Example Circuit for Using GPIO for inputs and outputs 


### Requisites 

1. Raspberry PI 
2. Jumper Wires
3. LED
4. Push Button Switch 
5. 10K ohms Resistor 
6. 560 ohmS Resistor



### Steps
1. Build a Ground Rail from your raspberry PI we will use this to ground the switch and the LED later on 
2. Connect one end of your 560 Ohms resistor to ground and the other end to one of the LED legs
3. Connect the other leg of the LED to the to a GPIO pin in this example it is GPIO17 
4. Connect one end of your 10k Ohms resitor to a 5V source and one of the usable legs of your switch
5. Connect the other usable leg of your Switch to a GPIO pin in this case GPIO26
